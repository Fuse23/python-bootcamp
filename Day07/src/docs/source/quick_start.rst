Quick Start
==============================

Welcome to the Voight-Kampff test, a tool for assessing empathy levels. This implementation is based on the Blade Runner universe. Follow the steps below to run the test:

1. **Installation:**

   Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Download the Code:**

   Download the Voight-Kampff test code from [GitHub](https://github.com/example/voight_kampff).

3. **Setup:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the downloaded code.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd path/to/voight_kampff

4. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required dependencies by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Prepare Test Questions:**

   Create a JSON file containing the test questions and options. See the `questions_ru.json` file for reference.

6. **Run the Test:**

   Execute the test by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python voight_kampff.py

   Follow the on-screen instructions to answer the questions. The test will calculate and display the final result.

7. **Interpreting Results:**

   - A positive result indicates characteristics associated with empathy.
   - A negative result suggests traits resembling replicants.

Feel free to customize the questions, options, and test conditions by modifying the JSON file or the code itself.

For additional details, refer to the class documentation in the code or the README file provided with the codebase.
